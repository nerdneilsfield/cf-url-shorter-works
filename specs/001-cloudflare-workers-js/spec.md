3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] where applicable
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úì Clear user flows identified for both admin and visitors
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úì Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What is the expected maximum number of active (non-expired) short links the system should support? ‚Üí A: Up to 1,000 links (personal/small project scale)
- Q: What is the acceptable time window for cache updates to propagate after a link is modified or deleted? ‚Üí A: Short delay (5-30 seconds) - brief inconsistency acceptable
- Q: What are the maximum allowed lengths for target URLs and custom aliases (slugs)? ‚Üí A: URL: 2,048 chars, Alias: 32 chars
- Q: Should the admin web interface support mobile phone screens, or is desktop/tablet support sufficient? ‚Üí A: Full mobile support required (screens ‚â•320px)
- Q: How frequently should the system run automatic cleanup of expired links? ‚Üí A: Every 24 hours (daily) - minimal overhead

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **content creator or marketer**, I want to create short, memorable links from long URLs so that I can share them easily on social media, track their usage, and manage them over time through a web-based admin interface. As an **end user**, I want shortened links to redirect me quickly and reliably to the intended destination.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Administrator Scenarios
1. **Given** I navigate to the admin page, **When** I enter my API token, **Then** I gain access to the link management interface
2. **Given** I am logged into the admin page, **When** I validate my API token, **Then** the system confirms whether the token is valid or invalid
3. **Given** I am logged into the admin page and want to create a custom alias, **When** I check if a slug is available through the interface, **Then** the system indicates whether the slug is available or conflicts with existing links or reserved paths
4. **Given** I am logged into the admin page and have a long URL, **When** I create a short link with a custom alias through the web interface, **Then** the system generates a short link using my specified alias and the configured domain
5. **Given** I am logged into the admin page and have a long URL, **When** I create a short link without specifying an alias through the web interface, **Then** the system generates a random, unique alias for the short link
6. **Given** I am logged into the admin page and have created a short link, **When** I set an expiration date through the web interface, **Then** the link automatically becomes invalid after that date
7. **Given** I am logged into the admin page, **When** I view the links list with search functionality, **Then** I can filter links by slug or target URL
8. **Given** I am logged into the admin page, **When** I view the links list with pagination, **Then** I see the current page range (e.g., "Showing 1-10 of 50 links") and can navigate between pages
9. **Given** I am logged into the admin page and want to modify a short link, **When** I update its target URL or expiration date through the web interface, **Then** the changes take effect immediately and I receive a success notification
10. **Given** I am logged into the admin page and no longer need a short link, **When** I delete it through the web interface, **Then** the link is removed, I receive a confirmation notification, and visitors see an error message when attempting to access it
11. **Given** I am logged into the admin page, **When** I view link statistics through the web interface, **Then** I see visit counts displayed as badges
12. **Given** I am logged into the admin page, **When** I copy a short link or target URL, **Then** the URL is copied to my clipboard and I receive a toast notification confirming the action

#### End User Scenarios
10. **Given** I receive a short link (e.g., yourdomain.com/abc123), **When** I click or visit it, **Then** I am redirected to the target URL quickly
11. **Given** I visit a short link that has expired, **When** I attempt to access it, **Then** I see an error message indicating the link is no longer valid
12. **Given** I visit a short link that doesn't exist, **When** I attempt to access it, **Then** I see an error message indicating the link was not found

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an administrator tries to create a custom alias that already exists through the web interface? The interface must display a clear error message and allow retry with a different alias.
- What happens when a link receives thousands of concurrent visits? System must maintain fast redirect performance and accurately record visit statistics without blocking.
- What happens when a link is updated while visitors are actively using it? System must serve the updated target URL with minimal delay.
- What happens when a link expires in the middle of high traffic? System must immediately return error responses for new requests.
- What happens when the administrator creates a link with an invalid target URL format through the web interface? The interface must validate and show an error before submission.
- What happens when the admin page loses connection to the API? The interface should display appropriate error messages and allow retry.
- What happens when an administrator's session expires while using the web interface? The system should prompt for re-authentication without losing unsaved work.
- What happens during the cache consistency window after link updates? Updates propagate within 5-30 seconds; visitors may see old target URLs during this brief window.
